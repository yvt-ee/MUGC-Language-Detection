# MUGC-Language-Detection

# Intro

The use of large language models (LLMs), has raised an important question: "How can we distinguish between human and machine-generated content?"

Language detection plays a crucial role in safeguarding intellectual property, ensuring information security, and upholding academic integrity. 

Our ultimate goal is to turn AI into a tool that assists rather than one that spreads misinformation or enables plagiarism. The importance of this objective is widely recognized.

# Technologies
